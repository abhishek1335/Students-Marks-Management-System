Student Marks Management System 🎓
A web-based application designed to automate the management and visualization of student examination results. This system specifically handles result PDFs released by JNTUK, parses the data, and stores it in a structured SQL database. It provides distinct dashboards for Faculty (to manage data) and Students (to view performance metrics like CGPA, SGPA, and Backlogs).

Here is a comprehensive and professional README.md file tailored for your Student Marks Management System. You can copy and paste this directly into your project repository.

I have included sections for features, installation, usage, and the technology stack, keeping the specific context of JNTUK results in mind.

🚀 Key Features
👨‍🏫 Faculty Dashboard (Admin)
Secure Login: Authentication system using password hashing for security.

PDF Upload: Faculty can upload raw result PDFs directly from the JNTUK releases.

Automated Parsing: The system automatically extracts student details, subject marks, and credits from the PDF.

Data Management: Efficiently stores parsed data into Student and Marks database tables.

👨‍🎓 Student Dashboard
Easy Access: Students can view results simply by entering their Roll Number.

Performance Metrics: Automatic calculation and display of:

SGPA (Semester Grade Point Average)

CGPA (Cumulative Grade Point Average)

Backlogs (Count of active backlogs)

Structured UI: A clean, responsive interface to view marks semester-wise.

🔐 Security & Architecture
Password Hashing: Implemented using libraries like Werkzeug or bcrypt to ensure passwords are never stored in plain text.

Role-Based Access: Strict separation between Admin (Faculty) capabilities and Student views.
